This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To run it, clone this repo, cd into it, and type

### `npm install`

### `npm start`

This app was built for Turing School of Software and Design's _Binary Challenge_ project. We were randomly given an API and a target audience, and told to make an app for it. You can read more about the project specs [Here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/binary-challenge.html)

For this challenge, I received the newsAPI as my data source, and my target audience was Turing Instructors. Since Turing staff (like it's students) are cramming and busy almost all the time, I created a very simple news app that would deliver curated information that'd be relevant to their day at Turing. Things they'd likely need to respond to questions about throughout their busy day.

## Inspiration

Turns out I'm incredibly motivated by food. I felt like I was pretty clever when I came up with the _ish_ brand, but that's not the case.
